# Magic Square Generator - Project Contents

This folder contains the complete source code and assets for the Magic Square Generator, including support for CLI execution and WebAssembly (WASM) for the web.

## Directory Structure

### Root Directory
- `Cargo.toml`: Rust project configuration with size and performance optimizations.
- `index.html`: Main web interface.
- `style.css`: Modern, premium styling for the web interface.
- `ui.js`: Javascript logic that bridges the UI with the WASM engine.
- `CONTENTS.md`: This file.

### [src/](file:///C:/Users/EngPartEmployee/OneDrive%20-%20NATS/Documents/AA/magic_squares/src) (Rust Source Code)
- `main.rs`: Entry point for the CLI application.
- `lib.rs`: Entry point for the WASM library exports.
- `rng.rs`: Custom Random Number Generator (LCG).
- `generator.rs`: Core magic square generation algorithms (Odd, Singly Even, Doubly Even).
- `validator.rs`: Logic to verify magic square properties.

### [pkg/](file:///C:/Users/EngPartEmployee/OneDrive%20-%20NATS/Documents/AA/magic_squares/pkg) (WASM Package)
- `magic_squares_bg.wasm`: The compiled WebAssembly binary.
- `magic_squares.js`: Javascript glue code generated by `wasm-pack`.
- `package.json`: NPM package metadata.

## How to Build from Source

### WebAssembly (Web Interface)
To rebuild the WASM package used by the web interface:
1. Ensure you have [`wasm-pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/) installed.
2. Open a terminal in the project root.
3. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   wasm-pack build --target web
   ```
4. This will update the files in the `pkg/` directory.

### CLI Application
To compile the command-line version:
1. Open a terminal in the project root.
2. Run `cargo build --release`.
3. The executable will be created at `target/release/magic_squares.exe`.
4. Run it using: `.\target\release\magic_squares.exe -n 7`

## How to Run

### Web Interface
Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser via a local web server (e.g., `python -m http.server`). Opening the file directly via `file://` may be blocked by browser security policies for WASM.

## Technical Details
- **Odd Orders**: De La Loubere method with 2-base array shuffling.
- **Singly Even**: LUX method.
- **Doubly Even**: Truth-grid method with random symmetries.
- **WASM**: Compiled with `wasm-bindgen` for high-performance browser execution.
